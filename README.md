# PhD-Scripts
Scripts developped during my PhD to accelerate analysis pipeline. They aim to help with image processing and data sorting.

The scripts I generate are free of use, I only ask for a citation if you publish work using it.
If you need any help understanding or using my scripts, feel free to contact me.
I welcome any feedback too !

I code in Matlab, ImageJ/Fiji (derived from Java), Python and VBA.
